**A C++ scoring algorithm for ranking global currencies based on financial market sentiment**

Master 203 C++ Project

Features:
- An object-oriented heritage architecture that allows developpers to input their own implementations
- Uses 25D risk reversal pairwise currency data (easily available on Bloomberg) to gauge financial market sentiment
- One can use butterfly values instead of risk reversal
- For importing data, needs 2 text files (as dataframes are not provided in C++): a string vector of currency tickers and an antisymmetric matrix of risk reversals
- An implementation on randomized data and a real-world snapshot is featured in this folder
